## React

# Why did you choose this subject?
  I choose this subject because am leaning more towards the front-end and I thought it would be a good opportunity to familiarize myself with React.  In the hopes to include this on my resume.  

# How were you first made aware of it?
  When we did the mini-lesson that I opted out of for review.  

# What problem does it solve?
  Building large applications with data that changes over time

  JS-heavy apps are typically not SEO friendly, React is more so.  

# How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
  Breaks code up into reusable components.  

  React solves this by running on the server, allowing the virtual DOM to be rendered and returned to the browser as a regular web page.

# Why does one use it?
  React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time.

# What are the alternatives?
  Riot  
# What is it similar to, if anything?
  From what I found it essentially does the same thing, but the syntax is more like Ruby on Rails than JS

# What is the history of this technology?
    React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML components framework for PHP.
# Who built it and why?
  React is intended to help developers build large applications that use data that changes over time. Its goal is to be simple, declarative and composable.

# Who is maintaining it?
  The developers at Facebook and Instagram.

# What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
  Was a lot more clear once I started playing around with the code.  I think it would take awhile to get used to the idea and syntax.  Trying to understand how the reusability works.  

# What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
  Understanding the Virtual Dom and trying to get a idea as to what exactly a component is.  

# What resources do you recommend for interested students?
  http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html
  Also, googling an image of the difference between the Virtual Dom and Dom.  

# What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
  https://www.syncano.io/reactjs-reasons-why-part-1/

# What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
  1. What is the Virtual Dom
  2. Describe what the JSXTransformer does.
  3. Why is React good for SEO.  

## Instructions

  I basically followed the tutorial on the http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html, which has all the code.  It has a link to Github where you can fork and clone their code down and then follow the instructions on their website.
